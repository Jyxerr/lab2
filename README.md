This program reads categories and offers games that fit these categories.<br >
The result is output to a file "output". <br >
If you don't care what is in this category, enter an empty string. <br >
If your query does not match any one game, then the output file will be empty <br>
Queries must match the categories in the table, otherwise the output will be incorrect. <br >
